1.0.0 - December 27, 2016
-------------------------

This is the first major release of csvkit in a very long time. The entire backend has been rewritten to leverage the `agate <https://agate.rtfd.io>`_ data analysis library, which was itself inspired by csvkit. The new backend provides better type detection accuracy, as well as some new features.

Because of the long and complex cycle behind this release, the list of changes should not be considered exhaustive. In particular, the output format of some tools may have changed in small ways. Any existing data pipelines using csvkit should be tested as part of the upgrade.

Much of the credit for this release goes to `James McKinney <https://github.com/jpmckinney>`_, who has almost single-handedly kept the csvkit fire burning for a year. Thanks, James!

Backwards-incompatible changes:

* :doc:`/scripts/csvjoin` renames duplicate columns with integer suffixes to prevent collisions in output.
* :doc:`/scripts/csvsql` generates ``DateTime`` columns instead of ``Time`` columns.
* :doc:`/scripts/csvsql` generates ``Decimal`` columns instead of ``Integer``, ``BigInteger``, and ``Float`` columns.
* :doc:`/scripts/csvsql` no longer generates max-length constraints for text columns.
* The ``--doublequote`` long flag is gone, and the ``-b`` short flag is an alias for ``--no-doublequote``.
* When using the ``--columns`` or ``--not-columns`` options, you must not have spaces around the comma-separated values, unless the column names contain spaces.
* When sorting, null values are greater than other values instead of less than.
* ``CSVKitReader``, ``CSVKitWriter``, ``CSVKitDictReader``, and ``CSVKitDictWriter`` have been removed. Use ``agate.csv.reader``, ``agate.csv.writer``, ``agate.csv.DictReader`` and ``agate.csv.DictWriter``.
* Drop Python 2.6 support (end-of-life was October 29, 2013).
* Drop support for older versions of PyPy.
* If ``--no-header-row`` is set, the output has column names ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, etc. instead of ``column1``, ``column2``, ``column3``, etc.
* csvlook renders a simpler, markdown-compatible table.

Fixes:
