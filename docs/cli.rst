To change field values (i.e. to run ``sed`` or ``awk``-like commands on CSV files), consider `miller <https://github.com/johnkerl/miller>`_ (``mlr put``).

To transpose CSVs, consider `csvtool <http://colin.maudry.com/csvtool-manual-page/>`_. Install ``csvtool`` on Linux using your package manager, or on macOS using::

    ln -s ~/.opam/system/bin/csvtool /usr/local/bin/
    csvtool --help
